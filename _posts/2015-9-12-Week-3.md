title: Collatz Collatz and more Collatz!
---
The second week with Dr. Downing was all about understanding our first project, Collatz! The Collatz problem seems pretty simple to code up with a naive solution but we are CS majors and we have to optimize the solution using caches and whatnot which makes this problem very very exciting to work on. Downing showed us several ways in class to optimize the solution and ended up explaining some different types of caches to us.
We also finally started using the various software engineering tools he wants us to use. Setting them up was definitely tricky but it seems as if it is worth it. This is where Piazza really helped me. Everyone in the class is really helpful and posted about the issues they had faced which made it easier for me to set up the tools needed.

I also finally started reading the book for the class and realized how informative the book is. The first two chapters covered basics of OOP such as abstraction, information hiding, polymorphism, encapsulation, but did so in a very simple way with great analogies that make it easier for someone without any experience to understand as well. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book and although the readings were slightly long they were worth it.
Also, Downing's quiz questions were largely derived from the book so definitely read the book closely.

Tip of the week:
Set up the environment needed to code early. You will be able to focus more on the problem at hand rather than spending all the time setting up the environment and then turning in a gacky solution because of lack of time.
