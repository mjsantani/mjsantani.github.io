title: Only a month left!
---
More than two-thirds of the semester is over and we have just a week left. I feel like I have learnt a whole bunch of C++ in this class including Copy Constructors, Initialization Lists, and in the last project "Darwin" I finally applied a lot of it. The last project was one of the very few projects I have done in which I had the freedom to completely design my own interface and OOP design for the project. THere were a lot of decisions that I had to make in terms of complexity and efficiency trade offs which was tough. We also couldn't use getters or setters which added a lot more complexity to the whole program because we couldn't just pass any value from an object and make it public unless absolutely necessary. 

We also started learning about inheritance in class and I finally understood the difference between a struct and a class and surprisingly the difference isn't too much. Having coded in Java for most of my time, it was interesting to see how inheritance in C++ is different from inheritance in Java and the key difference I saw was the difference in how dynamic binding and static binding work in C++.

Tip:
If you are new to C++ programming like I was, http://en.cppreference.com/w/ is a great resource that you can use. They have everything that you could possibly need when coding in C++. I have used this resource in every single project of mine and stackoverflow also helps a lot!
