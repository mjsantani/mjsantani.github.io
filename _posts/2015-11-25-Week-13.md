title: Test 2 is here!
---
Once again and for the last time a test is looming over us. Most people will be home shopping on Black Friday but this year I will be studying for the OOP Test while home. The amoung of material to be studied for this test is a lot and I don't really know where to start studying and for that matter even how to study. We learnt a bunch of concepts in class but it is hard for me to imagine how he would test us on the material. One thing I'm going to do differently this time is that I'm actually going to write down whatever it is that I'm trying to code to become confident in the concepts learnt in class and in coding in C++ although the projects have greatly helped with that.

Recently I have started understanding how programming languages can differ from each other. While both C++ and Java are Object Oriented Programming Languages, they handle certain things like inheritance, ".class" differently which can affect the design you come up with depending on the language you are using.

Tip: Most people code with headphones on and listen to music while coding. I used to do that all the time but once I accidentally forgot to turn on music but had my headphones on and was able to thing much better than I usually do and ever since I do not put on music when I'm coding as it helps me to focus better. But I definitely put on headphones so that I can block out outside ambient noise and sometimes people who will bother me ;)
