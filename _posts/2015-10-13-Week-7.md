title: After the test.
---
We just finished our first OOP test last week. It was not as scary as a lot of people had made it sound. It was definitely tricky in places but if studied well enough I don't think it was too hard. I have learnt that I should definitely use the computer to compile my code when studying for the test because as I was writing the solutions, I realized I wasn't very confident about the syntax and Dr. Downing had said that it is important to have the right syntax. I also wish I had studied with a group. I kind of went solo for this test because I didn't have a lot of time to prepare for the test but I feel like people who studied in a group were able to tackle a lot more types of possible algorithms that could have been asked.
Since the test is all coding, I felt like I made the right decision by not focusing on reading the textbook. It is very important to read the textbook for his quizzes though. It is very important to pay attention in class though. Some of the questions on the test were things he had told us would possibly be on the test. So paying attention is very important because for one you learn the concepts and two because there might be some info directly related to the test here and there.

Tip:
Read the class schedule regularly to check what is being covered in class and if there is no class. I unfortunately went to class when Dr. Downing had canceled class... Its the worst feeling ever.
